# Pathways 

##Synopsis 
Code for Pathways, a data storytelling website presenting a month's worth of mobile data collected from four groups of Londoners. The website presents visualizations, narrative, and analysis of the collected data. 
Paths were visualized using a combination of d3.js and leaflet.js.

For privacy reasons, the geojson data files of the participants are not included in repo. For space reasons, the map tiles are also not included. Tiles were created using Tilemill 4 (not Mapbox Studio). 

Pathways was created as part of the National Geographic Digital Storytelling Fellowship. For more informatino on the project and fellowship, see the [project blogposts](voices.nationalgeographic.com/author/monuoha/).
