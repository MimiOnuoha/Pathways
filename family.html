         <h4> Not everyone's life revolves around a new baby </h4>

         <p> Originally, I was gathering the data of multiple extended family members, but I quickly realized that unless the people had changed their daily lives because of the baby, it was impossible to see anything interesting. </p>

        <p> The father does some shit but like who even knows what </p>
