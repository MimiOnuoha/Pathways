        <h4> Immediate Family is Immediately Affected </h4></br>

         <p> I gathered data from multiple family members and saw that the data from the <strong> extended family </strong> made it harder to see what was happening for the nuclear family.   </p>

          <h4>Final Note: There's no such thing as being "data-less":</h4> </br>
          <p> On the map, you can always guess where the baby is at any given time just by knowing where the parents are.  </p>

        <p> You can figure out exactly when the baby was born just by looking at Facebook activity. </p>

        <p>  Your birth is all about you, and its a day of which you likely know very little. </p>
        <p>  This is the map of a child's first few weeks of life. What would yours look like? </p></br>
