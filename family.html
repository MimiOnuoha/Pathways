          <h2>The Story of <strong>A Family</strong></h2>
       <section>

        <p class="fragment">Take a look at the data of what it looks like when a new baby is born in a family. </p>

        <h4> Not everyone's life revolves around a new baby </h4></br>

         <p> Originally, I was gathering the data of multiple extended family members, but I quickly realized that unless the people had changed their daily lives because of the baby, it was impossible to see anything interesting. </p>

      </section>


       <section data-markdown data-autoslide = "5000" data-background = "#F7F6F4">
             <h4> But some people's lives are closely connected to the new baby </h4></br>

        <p> The mother of the child stays at home until the day that the baby is born.</p>
        <p> The mother-in-law moves in for the month of the child's life </p>
        <p> The father does some shit but like who even knows what </p>
    

      </section>

      <section data-autoslide = "5000" data-background = "#F7F6F4">

       <h4>There's no such thing as data-less:<h4> </br>

          <p> The baby was the only person in the immediate family who I didn't track, but you can still almost always tell where it is. </p>
        
      </section>


      <section data-background = "#F7F6F4">
        <h4>Layered Data, Layered Meaning </h4></br>
        <p> You can figure out exactly when the baby was born just by looking at Facebook activity. </p>

        <p> See the map for more. </p>
