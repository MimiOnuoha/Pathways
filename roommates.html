       <section>

        <p class="fragment"> This is the story of three friends and roommates </p></br>
        <p class="fragment"> ...in their last month of living together. </p></br>
        <p class="fragment"> This is the story of the data of a goodbye. </p>

      <section data-markdown data-background = "#191950">
          <h4 class = "left"><strong> Life Is Mundane </strong> </h4> </br>

        <p class="fragment left"> I tracked the roommates for nearly a month, and the biggest thing that emerged was the mundanity of everyday life. </p></br>

        <p class="fragment left"> Their map shows the roommates going to work, coming home, and going out. </p></br>

        <p class ="fragment left"> Conclusion: the impending farewell didn't alter their everyday life. </p>

    	 <h4 class = "left"><strong> Goodbyes Are Different </strong></h4></br>

       <p class ="fragment left"> The fact that their geolocation data didn't easily represent the emotional experience of their goodbye doesn't render it unimportant. </p>

        <p class="fragment left">In fact, on Roommate 2's final weekend in London, <strong>all three of the roommates spent substantially more of their time together</strong>. </p></br>

        <p class ="fragment left"> On the map, this is the final weekend that they were tracked. </p>

       <p class ="fragment left"> Goodbyes are hard to say, and harder to track.  </p></br>
