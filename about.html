        <p class = "section-description about-text"> <em>Pathways</em> is a creative data project showing <strong>a month's worth of geolocation data and message metadata</strong> collected from the mobile phones of Londoners. 

          The aim of Pathways is to show what digital data looks like in the context of common relationships. As the number of internet-enabled devices increases, we generate more and more data that is intimately and invisibly connected to us. This is the reality within which <em>Pathways</em> is situated.</p>

          <p class="about-text"> All participants willingly volunteered their data; data was retained solely for the duration of the project. Participants were found through in-person recruitment and email open calls.</p>

            <p class = "about-text">This project was created by <a href = "twitter.com/thistimeitsmimi">Mimi Onuoha</a> as part of the 2014-15 Fulbright-National Geographic Digital Storytelling Fellowship. To learn more about the development process and the themes that inspired the project, see the project posts on National Geographic's <a href = "http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/author/monuoha/"> blog</a>.
